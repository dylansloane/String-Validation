Coding Problem.

Can you determine if a string is a “valid” sentence, based on a simple set of rules? 
For the purposes of this problem, a “valid” sentence is defined as:
1. String starts with a capital letter. 
2. String has an even number of quotation marks. 
3. String ends with one of the following sentence termination characters: ".", "?", "!". 
4. String has no period characters other than the last character. 
5. Numbers below 13 are spelled out (”one”, “two”, "three”, etc…).
